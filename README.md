Repository for Udemy Course - Snowflake Decoded - Fundamentals and hands on Training

This course provides Snowflake concepts & hands on expertise to help get you started on implementing solutions using Snowflake. This course reinforces the learning through hands on labs, assignments & quizzes.
At a high level we will go through the following topics

**Introduction** -  A bit of history about snowflake & its differentiation.

**Getting Started with Snowflake** - Sign up for a snowflake trial, setup the required tools and will create & load our first table into Snowflake

**Architecture** - A look into the snowflake concepts, how the snowflake decoupled architecture differs from the traditional database architectures. We will explore how Snowflake virtual warehouses allow scaling up and down of compute as per demand.

**Getting data into Snowflake** - We will explore the ingestion or loading methods available in Snowflake i.e. bulk copy & snowpipe. We will stage the data in an S3 bucket and load into Snowflake table using both bulk copy and snowpipe. We will also explore ways to load semi structured data like JSON into Snowflake.

**Time Travel & Zero Copy Clones** - Time travel & cloning is a very powerful feature unique to Snowflake. We will explore how time travel can help you recover data before a query was run or before a specific time. Combine time travel with cloning and you can create new tables which contain data back in time, and all that without incurring additional storage cost.

**Secure Data Sharing** - Snowflake based solutions can easily share data with other Snowflake users as well as non Snowflake users. We will explore ways on how to share your data and also how the sharing reuses existing storage.
